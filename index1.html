            <h2>Missile man of india</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was an Indian scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. 
                He was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and came from a humble background. 
                He studied aerospace engineering and eventually became known as the
                "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile technology.

                Kalam played a crucial role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear weapon state.
                Before his presidency, he served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO).

                During his presidency, Kalam was known for his inspirational speeches and his focus on education and youth empowerment. 
                He was a popular president, often referred to as the "People's President," and was admired for his humility, simplicity, and dedication to public service.

                After his presidency, Kalam continued to be involved in educational and humanitarian work. He passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. 
                He is remembered as a visionary leader who inspired millions with his ideas and ideals.
